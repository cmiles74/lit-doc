Lit-Doc
=======

Lit-Doc is a simple literate documentation generator for Clojure
source code. I say simple because it's simple-minded, it extracts
comments that begin with double semi-colons and treats that as the
"literate" documentation.

I have a sample posted, it was generated by running against itself.

Usage
-----

This tool isn't particularly user-friendly or full featured. It
doesn't provide nice index files or handle regular Clojure
documentation strings. Still, if you'd like to try it out, you can
pull down a copy of this repository and use 
[Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) to build it.

    git clone https://cmiles74@github.com/cmiles74/lit-doc.git
    cd lit-doc
    lein uberjar

You can then copy the standalone jar file into your project and invoke
it from the command line.

    java -jar lit-doc-x.xx-standalone-jar -s src -d lit-doc

The above invocation will scan through the directory "src" and
generate documentation for all the Clojure files found, writing them
out to a directory called "lit-doc".

Comment Conventions
-------------------

Lit-doc will only extract comments that begin with a two semi-colons
(";;"). It will take a run of these comments and then run them through
a Markdown converter to generate the HTML that it writes to your
documentation file. You can use any legal Markdown syntax you like.

That's it!
