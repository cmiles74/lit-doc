# Lit-Doc

Lit-Doc is a simple literate documentation generator for Clojure
source code. I say simple because it's simple-minded, it extracts
comments that begin with double semi-colons and treats that as the
"literate" documentation.

I have a sample posted, it was generated by running against itself.
